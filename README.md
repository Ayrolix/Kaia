# Introduction

Hello everyone and welcome to the home page of my bot! Kaia is a hobby project I've been working on in my off time with simple commands. I will go over those commands in a moment but in the meantime **I want to say thank you for taking the time for looking at my project! It means a lot!**

This bot is SFW. It won't become NSFW any time in the future! So any commands regarding "Horny" is actually SFW.  

Default prefix is the dollar symbol ($). You may change it if you want.
